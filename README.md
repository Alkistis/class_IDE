CLASS code for the "pure momentum transfer" coupled quintessence model first introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0458 (the so-called "Type 3" theories in that paper). For more numerical results/plots also see https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04222, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05196, and https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09858.
